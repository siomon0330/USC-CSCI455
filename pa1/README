ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved, and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

The program will crash if the input number overflows.

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

	1 What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two? 

         The probability of the three outcomes are:
         Two heads: 25%;
         Two Tails:25%;
         A Head and a Tail:50%.
         Each time you toss a coin, you get 50% probability of a Head and a Tail, and if you toss a coin twice, you will get four results: Head+Head,  Head+Tail,  Tail+Head, Tail+Tail, each of them get 25% probability, since there are twice Head+Tail, itâ€™s total probability is 50%.

	2 Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

         When the input number get 10^5, the results are within 1% of these probability.
 
	3 Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your program to verify that it actually works for very large values that are within the limits. Warning: For very large values you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results (probably slower on aludra than on you own machine). 

    When the input get as large as 10^9, the results takes very very long time to show up on my machine, and when the number gets 2^31(2147483648), it crashes with an overflow error. Since the maximum number of int is 2^31 - 1.
