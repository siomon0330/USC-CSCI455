<h2> CS 455 Lab 12: C++ Debugger / Linked lists</h2>

<h3> Goals and Background </h3>

This lab will give you some practice with linked lists, along the way
introducing you to a symbolic debugger to use with g++-compiled
programs on Unix.
<p>
The linked list aspect of the lab is to give you practice with
reasoning about and writing linked list code, by dealing with some
buggy linked list code.  One focus of this lab is not debugging per
se, but being able to predict a program's behavior from looking at the
code; this will help you write correct code.
<p>
The lab instructions assume you will be using the <kbd>gdb</kbd>
debugger which can run inside of emacs.  For easy reference while doing the lab, you may want to print out the
help-sheet called "Debugging in Unix" that's linked in the next
section.  There is also a
graphical oriented <kbd>ddd</kbd> debugger described in that debugging
handout: it's very slow to start up (which may be exacerbated if you
all do it at the same time during the lab), and has a few other
glitches; we don't recommend you use it for the purposes of this lab.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> some of the functions here use PRE/POST style of function
comments.  You are already familiar with preconditions.  A
postcondition describes what is true after the function executes (that
is, if the precondition is met before the call, the postcondition will
be true after the call).  Sometimes the postcondition needs to refer to the
updated value of a reference parameter as well as its
original value.  To distinguish these two, we'll use ' to denote the
updated one.  E.g., in Exercise 3 below, the append function
postcondition comment says:

<pre>
// POST: list' is same as list, but with item appended
</pre>

<kbd>list </kbd> refers to the value of the list <em>before</em> the call, and
<kbd> list' </kbd> refers to the value of the list <em>after</em> the call.

<H3>Exercise 0</H3>

<p>
<a name="gdb"><strong><kbd>gdb</kbd> version</strong></a>

<br>

If you didn't check what version of gdb you had in lab last week, you
can do so now (see <a href="../lab11/lab11.html">lab 11, Exercise 0</a> for
details).  


<H3>Exercise 1 (1 checkoff point)</H3>
<p>
Copy the files for the lab to your account by typing:

<pre> cp -r ~csci455/labs/lab12 lab12 </pre>

<p>

Load the source code file <a href="factors.cpp"><KBD>factors.cpp</KBD></a> into emacs.
<p>
<KBD>factors.cpp</KBD> is a program for calculating all of the factors
of a number.  The program does not quite work as is.  Since you've
seen it before, it will be easy to debug it: the goal here is to use
<kbd>gdb</kbd>.
<p>
Compile and run the <kbd>factors.cpp</kbd> program.  To make this
easier for you, we've created a Makefile for you with rules for
compiling all the code for this lab.  To compile factors inside emacs,
type esc-x compile (like we did for Java programs), then give the
command

<pre>
gmake factors
</pre>

This makes an executable called <kbd>factors</kbd>.
<p>
<hr>
<strong>More about <kbd>gmake</kbd> and <kbd>Makefile<kbd>s</strong>.  
We will often put our compile commands in a Makefile, especially when we start
compiling multi-file programs in C++, because the compile steps can
get complicated.  So, here we run <kbd>gmake</kbd>, instead of
<kbd>g++</kbd> directly.  <kbd>gmake</kbd> uses the rules in the
<kbd>Makefile</kbd> to decide what needs to be done.  You can look in the
<a href="Makefile"><kbd>Makefile</kbd></a> we're using here to see
what command it runs (look for the line that says <kbd>factors:</kbd>)
<hr>
<p>
Use <kbd>gdb</kbd> to find out where the program crashed.  See the
<a
href="../../doc/debug.html">debugging handout
</a>
 for how to start up <kbd>gdb</kbd> from inside emacs, and for how to
use it in this kind of situation.  Note: when running gdb from emacs,
it will show the current line being executed by a little arrow to the
left of that line in a separate source code buffer.  Use
<kbd>gdb</kbd> and program examination to find the cause of the error,
and fix it.  The mistake causing the run-time error can be corrected by
changing only <EM>one</EM> line.
<p>
Note: when the program crashes it may say "core dumped"; this means a
large file, called <kbd>core</kbd> containing the contents of memory
at the time of the crash is now in your directory.  In dire
circumstances you could examine this file to help you debug, but we
will not need it here, so delete it.
<p>
Recompile your new version and run it.  (Hint: You can abort a program
by typing <KBD>ctrl-c</KBD>, or if you're running in an emacs shell
window, <KBD>ctrl-c ctrl-c</KBD>.)  Use <kbd>gdb</kbd> again to help
find the remaining error: You can abort the program from inside
<kbd>gdb</kbd> to see where it is executing, then you can look at the
values of variables.  See the debugging handout for more details.
<p>
For check-off show the TA your working working <kbd>factors</kbd>
program running in <kbd>gdb</kbd> under emacs.  In particular show him how you
set a breakpoint, run to the breakpoint, and then single step through
the program for a few iterations, displaying the values of key
variables.

<H3>Exercise 2 (1 checkoff point)</H3>

Note: the beginning of this and the next exercise involves your
stepping away from the computer and using pencil and
paper.  The best approach is probably for you and your partner to each
draw the diagram independently, and then get together to reconcile the
results.

<PRE>
// BUGGY sumList
// PRE: list is a well-formed list
// POST: returns sum of elements in list
int sumList (Node *list)
{
  Node *p = list;
  int sum = 0;

  while (p!=NULL) {
    sum += p->data;
    p->next = p;
  }
  return sum;
}
</PRE>
<p>
Draw a box-and-pointer diagram showing the state of <KBD>sumList</KBD> on
entry with a non-empty list, and after each of several iterations of
the loop.
<p>
The <a href="testlist.cpp"><kbd>testlist.cpp</kbd></a> program is a
small interactive program to test several linked list routines,
including <kbd>sumList</kbd>.  You can compile it using the command
<kbd>gmake testlist</kbd>.  Note: don't be surprised that the "b"uild
function of <kbd>testlist</kbd> builds the list in reverse order from
the order the values are entered.
<p>
Compile and run the <kbd>testlist</kbd> program to test
<KBD>sumList</KBD> and verify your appraisal of what it currently
does.  The command <kbd>gmake testlist</kbd> will work to compile it.
Use <KBD>gdb</KBD> to verify your box-and-pointer diagram for the
buggy <KBD>sumList</KBD> function.  HINT: if you <KBD>print</KBD> a
pointer in <KBD>gdb</KBD> you get its value, which is an address (in
hex).  To see what a pointer, <KBD>p</KBD>, points to, you can
<KBD>print *p</KBD>.  If two pointers point to the same object, you
will know this because they will have the same address.
<p>
For checkoff show the t.a. your diagram, describe what happened in
<KBD>gdb</KBD>, and show him what the fix was.
<p>
<H3>Exercise 3 (1 checkoff point)</H3>
<p>
<PRE>
// BUGGY append routine
// PRE: list is a well-formed list
// POST: list' is same as list, but with item appended
void append (Node * &list, int item)
{
  Node *p = list;

  if (p == NULL) {
    insertFront(list, item);
    return;
  }

  while (p->next != NULL) {
    p = p->next;
  }

  p = new Node(item);

}
</PRE>
<p>
On paper create a box-and-pointer diagram for <KBD>append</KBD> of an empty list,
and append of a non-empty list.
<p>
Compile and run the program to test <KBD>append</KBD> and verify your
appraisal of what it currently does.  Use <KBD>gdb</KBD> if necessary to get
further information.
<p>
Fix the problem, and create a box-and-pointer diagram for the
corrected version showing the values of the variables at the end of
the function.
<p>
For checkoff, show the TA your two diagrams, and the corrected version
of the program.

<H3>Exercise 4 (1 checkoff point)</H3>
<p>
Complete the implementation of the function <KBD>printEveryOther</KBD>
(skeleton of body and call already appear in <KBD>testlist.cpp</KBD>).
<p>
Your implementation must only do about <EM>n/2</EM> iterations of the
loop, where <EM>n</EM> is the length of the list.  Your code must work
for both even- and odd-length lists.  Here's the skeleton:
<p>
<PRE>
// printEveryOther: prints 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... elements in a list
// PRE: list is a well-formed linked list
void printEveryOther(Node * list)
{
  while (list != NULL) {
    cout << list->data << " ";

    // YOU COMPLETE THE BODY OF THE LOOP
  }
  cout << endl;
}
</PRE>

<hr>
<H3>Checkoff for DEN students</H3>
